# A very basic Nginx configuration to serve static files.
# Cloud Run expects applications to listen on the port specified by the PORT environment variable,
# which defaults to 8080.

    # Specify the default file to serve when a directory is requested (e.g., your-app.run.app/)

    # This block handles requests. It tries to serve the requested file ($uri),
    # then if it's a directory ($uri/), and finally returns a 404 if not found.
